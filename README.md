# CS-230-Gaming-Room


    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    
    The Gaming Room is a client who wanted to build an app to replicate the draw it or list it game. Their requirements includeded a client server deployment, that was compatible with a variety of browsers on all the major operating systems and gaming systems. The software was a web app game designed for multiplayer play with end users on all major OS's.
    
    
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    
    This documentation does a good job at defining the requirements for the game, and giving best practice recommendations. It also draws the class infrastructure of the app out in a UML diagram. Together these two give the client a good idea into what they should consider when building the app in production. 
    
    
    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    
    What I found helpful was that their is always clarity on what the client wants in their app, it takes out a lot of the guessing work when developing the app. This can often standardize applications and code, ultimately giving a faster time to market. 
    
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    
    I would include a section for depencencies, that would list all the software required to run the app. This could help compliance people ensure the app meets all requirements. 
    
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    
    Implementing the users needs is the most important part of the project because thats what the user stories will be built out of ultimately.
